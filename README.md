How to get it running locally from scratch
------------------------------------------

This section assumes you know about and are using a
[virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/).
If you're not familiar with `virtualenv`, that's fine. You can use your "system python"
but a virtualenv is advantageous because you get a self-contained python system
that doesn't affect and isn't affected by any other python projects on your
computer.

Also, these instructions are **geared towards developers** working on the code.
Not system people deploying the code for production.

**Step 1 - The stuff you need**

You're going to need Git, Python 2.6 or Python 2.7, a PostgreSQL database
(partially works with MySQL and SQLite too) and the necessary python dev
libraries so you can install binary python packages. On a mac, that means you
need to install XCode and on Linux you'll need to install `python-dev`.

[This article on pyladies.com](http://www.pyladies.com/blog/Get-Your-Mac-Ready-for-Python-Programming/)
has a lot of useful information.

**Step 2 - Get the code**

Note: We're assuming you have already activated a `virtualenv` which will
have its own `pip`.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mozilla/airmozilla.git
cd airmozilla
pip install -r requirements/compiled.txt
```

If you intend to use this for also running tests, you need to install
one more file:

```
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

**Step 3 - Create a database**

To create a database in PostgreSQL there are different approaches. The simplest
is the `createdb` command. How you handle credentials, roles and permissions is
generally out of scope for this tutorial.

```
createdb -E UTF8 airmozilla
```

You might at that point need to supply a specific username and/or password.
Whichever it is, take a note of it because you'll need it to set up your settings.

**Step 4 - Set up the settings**

The first thing to do is to copy the settings "template".

```
cp airmozilla/settings/local.py-dist airmozilla/settings/local.py
```
Now open that `airmozilla/settings/local.py` in your editor and we'll go
through some essential bits.

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'airmozilla',
        'USER': 'username',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': '',
        'PORT': '',
    },
    # 'slave': {
    #     ...
    # },
}
```
Here, replace `username` and `password` accordingly.
If you want to use MySQL, which should work except the Search, you replace
the `ENGINE` setting with `django.db.backends.mysql`.

If you're a developer and intend to run tests make sure you have this line uncommented:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = base.INSTALLED_APPS + ['django_nose']
```
For local development, make sure the following lines are uncommented:
```
DEBUG = TEMPLATE_DEBUG = True
```
Since Air Mozilla uses a lot of AJAX calls, it may not be useful for errors to
show up in the browser when they happen. It may be more useful to have all
the errors appear in the terminal console. This is a matter of personal
taste, but if you want all the errors to appear in the terminal add this line:
```
DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS = True
```

And, since you're probably going to run the local server NOT on HTTPS
you uncomment this line:
```
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False
```
For security, you need to enter something into the `HMAC_KEYS`.
The same is true for `SECRET_KEY`.
```
HMAC_KEYS = {
    'any': 'thing',
}

SECRET_KEY = 'somethingnotempty'
```

By default, you need a `Memcache` server up and running. The connection
settings for that is not entered by default. So if you have a Memcache running
on the default port you need to enter it for the `LOCATION` setting like this:
```
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',
        'KEY_PREFIX': 'airmoz',
        'TIMEOUT': 6 * 60 * 60,
        'LOCATION': 'localhost:11211'
    }
}
```

If you want to use a local in-memory cache instead, use the following
`CACHES` setting:
```
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',
        'LOCATION': 'unique-snowflake'
    }
}
```
By default, all the default settings are geared towards production
deployment. Not local development. For example, the default way of handling
emails is to actually send them with SMTP. For local development we don't want
this. So uncomment the line `EMAIL_BACKEND` to:
```
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```

The majority of the remaining settings are important security details for
third-party services like AWS, Vid.ly, Mozillians, Twitter, Bit.ly and
Sentry.

Getting actual details there is a matter of trust and your relationship to the
project. Some things will obviously not work without these secrets, the file
upload for example won't work without AWS credentials. But things aren't
necessary should be something you can just go around. If something doesn't work
at all without having certain security settings, it's considered a bug.

**Step 5 - Running for the first time**

The very first thing to run are these commands:

```
./manage.py syncdb
./manage.py migrate
```
The `syncdb` command will ask you to set up a first default superuser. Make
sure you use an email address that you can log in to Persona with.

And last but not least:
```
./manage.py runserver
```

Now you should be able to open `http://localhost:8000`.

How to get it running with Docker
---------------------------------

You need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation) in your machine and then you
can build the image, but first you have to modify your `airmozilla/settings/local.py`
file so it can connect to the database.

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'airmozilla',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': 'mozilla',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    },
    # 'slave': {
    #     ...
    # },
}
```

After this you can build your image:

```
docker build -t airmozilla .
```

Finally you have to make a container run based on this image, share your
local directory and declare the port where you are going to connect:

```
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name web -v /full/path/to/airmozilla:/airmozilla airmozilla
```

With this if your are on Linux you can connect to `localhost:8000` or to
`192.168.59.103:8000` if you are on Windows or Mac.
Due the fact that on Windows and Mac docker uses boot2docker this ip can change
at some point, to know the exact ip address you can execute `boot2docker ip`.

If you want to run all tests you can execute:

```
docker exec -it web ./manage.py test
```

Getting help
------------

The best place to get help on development is to go the the `#airmozilla-dev`
IRC channel on `irc.mozilla.org`.


Tests and test coverage
-----------------------
Included is a set of comprehensive tests, which you can run by:
``./manage.py test``

To see the tests' code coverage, use:
``./manage.py test --with-coverage --cover-erase --cover-html --cover-package=airmozilla``

Then, when it completes, open the file `./cover/index.html`.

You can run tests with any level of granularity:
To run a specific file, use:
``./manage.py test -s -x airmozilla/manage/tests/test_forms.py``

To run a specific test case class in a file:
``./manage.py test -s -x airmozilla/manage/tests/test_forms.py:SomeTestCaseClass``

To run a specific test in a class in a specific file:
``./manage.py test -s -x airmozilla/manage/tests/test_forms.py:SomeTestCaseClass.test_some_function``

The -s makes it so that any print statements aren't swallowed if tests pass. The -x means it bails as soon as 1 test fails.

Troubleshooting
--------------

### ImportErrors

If you get import errors, make sure the directory `./vendor/src/` is not empty
or contains only directories that are empty. If they are empty, run the
following command:

``git submodule update --init --recursive``

### Unable to sign in

There are several reasons why sign in might not work. A common problem is that
you have problems with CSRF and those are usually because of caching not
working. Or a security setting.

If you see this in the `runserver` logs:

```
15/Oct/201X 14:53:37] "POST /browserid/login/ HTTP/1.1" 403 2294
```

It means that the server gave you a cookie which couldn't be matched and checked
when sent back to the server later.

To check that caching works run these blocks:

```
./manage.py shell
>>> from django.core.cache import cache
>>> cache.set('some', 'thing', 60)
>>> ^D
```
(`^D` means `Ctrl-D` which means to exit the shell) then
```
./manage.py shell
>>> from django.core.cache import cache
>>> cache.get('some')
'thing'
```

If it doesn't say `'thing'` it means it wasn't able to cache things.
This is most likely because you have configured
`django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache` as your preferred
cache backend but that server isn't up and running.

Consider then to either figure out how to start your memcache server or switch
to `django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache`.

Another common mistake is to *not* have `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False` in your
`airmozilla/settings/local.py` but using `http://localhost:8000` to reach
the site.


Migrations
----------
We're using [South][south] to handle database migrations.
To generate a schema migration, make changes to models.py, then run:

``./manage.py schemamigration airmozilla.main --auto``

or

``./manage.py schemamigration airmozilla.comments --auto``

To generate a blank data migration, use:

``./manage.py datamigration airmozilla.main data_migration_name``

Then fill in the generated file with logic, fixtures, etc.

To apply migrations:

```
./manage.py migrate airmozilla.main
./manage.py migrate airmozilla.comments
./manage.py migrate airmozilla.uploads
./manage.py migrate airmozilla.subtitles
./manage.py migrate airmozilla.surveys
./manage.py migrate airmozilla.cronlogger
```

In each command, replace airmozilla.main with the appropriate app.


Requirements
------------
See the ``requirements/`` directory for installation dependencies.
This app requires a working install of PIL with libjpeg and libpng.


First run
-----------------------
```
./manage.py syncdb
./manage.py migrate
```

If you'd like to create a default set of example groups with useful permissions
(Event Organizers, Experienced Event Organizers, PR, Producer):

``./manage.py create_mozilla_groups``


Logging in
----------

We use [Persona](https://login.persona.org) to handle all log in.
If you haven't used it before, it's fine. It's free and easy and works with
any email address.

Because the code is built to only allow people with certain email address
domains, (e.g. `mozilla.com`) you might need to fake this if you don't have
a `mozilla.com` email address. To do that, open the file
`airmozilla/settings/local.py` and add to the bottom this:

```
ALLOWED_BID = base.ALLOWED_BID + (
    'gmail.com',
)
```
...assuming your preferred email address is a `gmail.com` one. But note, only
enter the *domain* of your email address. Not the whole email address.

Becoming a Superuser
--------------------

Superusers have full unbound permissions to do anything and everything.

On a blank database with no content, the only way to become a Superuser
is to sign in once, then go to the command line and manually change the
data so that you're now a superuser.

```
./manage.py shell
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> my_user = User.objects.get(email='my@email.com')
>>> my_user.is_superuser = True
>>> my_user.is_staff = True
>>> my_user.save()
```

Adding a sample video
---------------------

Once you're a superuser, the simplest way to add sample content is to
use existing media from Air Mozilla. We're first going to create a
template, then create content based on this template.

Let's create the Video template:

 * Go to the management page at `http://localhost:8000/manage`
 * Click on `Video templates` in the left menu, and initiate a
   template with `New template`
 * Fill the `Name` with "Vid.ly"
 * Fill the `Content` with

    ```html
    <iframe frameborder="0" allowfullscreen width="640" height="360" name="vidly-frame"
     src="https://vid.ly/embeded.html?link={{ tag }}&amp;new=1&amp;autoplay={{autoplay}}&amp;hd=yes"></iframe>
    ```
 * Save changes

We're now going to initiate an event with this template:

 * Click on `Initiate event` in the left menu of the management
   page
 * Choose the `Vid.ly` template
 * Replace the Template environment with `tag=7u9u1i`
 * Change status to `Scheduled`
 * Choose a title, a description, a start time, a channel (Main) and a
   placeholder image
 * Save and submit

You should now see your video in the Event manager
(`http://localhost:8000/manage/events/`) and on the main page
(`http://localhost:8000/`)!

Cron jobs
---------

All cron jobs are managed by two files: First
``airmozilla/manage/crons.py`` where you kick things off. Then, later
the crontab file is compiled and installed by
``bin/crontab/crontab.tpl``. These are the two files you need to edit
to change, add or remove a cron execution.


Twitter
-------

To test tweeting locally, what you need to do is set up some fake
authentication credentials and lastly enable a debugging backend. So,
add this to your settings/local.py:

    TWITTER_USERNAME = 'airmozilla_dev'
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY = 'something'
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = 'something'
    TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'something'
    TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'something'

Now, to avoid actually using HTTP to post this message to
api.twitter.com instead add this to your settings/local.py:

    TWEETER_BACKEND = 'airmozilla.manage.tweeter.ConsoleTweeter'

That means that all tweets will be sent to stdout instead of actually
being attempted.

To send unsent tweets, you need to call:

    ./manage.py cron send_unsent_tweets

This can be called again and again and internally it will take care of
not sending the same tweet twice.

If errors occur when trying to send, the tweet will be re-attempted
till the error finally goes away.


Deployment
----------

Deployment of dev, stage and prod is all done using Chief. More will
be written about it soon.


Bit.ly URL Shortener
--------------------

To generate a Bit.ly access token you need the right email address and
password. If you have access you can go to
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=870385#c2

To generate it use this command:

    curl -u "EMAIL:PASSWORD" -X POST "https://api-ssl.bitly.com/oauth/access_token"

That will spit out a 40 character code which you set in
settings/local.py for the ``BITLY_ACCESS_TOKEN`` setting.


About the database
------------------

Even though we use the Django ORM which is database engine agnostic,
we have to have PostgreSQL because we rely on its ability to do
fulltext index searches.


PEP8 and pyflakes
-----------------

All (with some few exceptions) code needs to be fully
[pep8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and
[pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes) compliant. And line length
for Python is expected to be under 80 characters wide.

The help yourself enforce this automatically, you need to set up the following
git hooks. First, in your virtualenv, install this:

    pip install flake8

Next you need to create (or amend) the file:

    .git/hooks/pre-commit

...to contain the folllowing...:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

exit_code=0

for file in `git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | sort | uniq`
    do
        if [ ${file: -3} == ".py" ]; then
            flake8 $file
            if [ "$?" -ne "0" ]; then
                exit_code=1
            fi
        fi
        if [ ${file: -3} == ".js" ]; then
            jshint $file
            if [ "$?" -ne "0" ]; then
                exit_code=1
            fi
        fi
    done

if [ "$exit_code" -ne "0" ]; then
    echo "Aborting commit.  Fix above errors or do 'git commit --no-verify'."
    exit 1
fi
```

And make sure it's executable by running:

    chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

Next time you type `git commit -a -m "fixes bug"` it might block you and spit
out a message like this instead:

```
airmozilla/main/views.py:17:1: F401 'Sum' imported but unused
airmozilla/main/views.py:378:80: E501 line too long (81 > 79 characters)
Aborting commit.  Fix above errors or do 'git commit --no-verify'.
```
